# Magento 2 Theme Boilerplate

> A child theme boilerplate for our M2base core theme

**Please Note:** This is set up to work with our M2base theme as a parent, so probably isn&#8217;t much use to anyone else.

## Usage

1. Clone/download the repo and merge the files into your Magento 2 site, following the same directory structure
2. Change all occurrences in the folders names and files of `MyTheme`, `myTheme` and `mytheme` to the name of your new theme (you could do a case sensitive find & replace)
3. Register the theme in `dev/themes-custom.js` (see `docs/frontend-build.md` for more info)
4. Add post install and update script to `composer.json` (see `docs/frontend-build.md` for more info)

## Frontend Build

See the included `docs/frontend-build.md` doc.
