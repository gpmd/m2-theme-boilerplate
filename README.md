# M2 Theme Boilerplate

> This boilerplate theme is designed to be the starting point for a child theme of our M2base theme.

## Usage

1. Clone/download the repo and merge the files into your Magento 2 site
2. Change all occurrences in the folders names and files of `MyTheme` and `mytheme` to the name of your new theme
3. Add a new config block to your site&#8217;s `themes.js` (using `tools/dev/themes.js.sample` as a reference)
